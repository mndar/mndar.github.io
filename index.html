      <h4>Loyalty Programme For a Premier Retail Chain In Bahrain</h4>
      <p><i>Mifare Smart Cards and Payments Terminals & Pinpads Interfaced Over RS232</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p><b><u>The Requirement:</u></b></p>
      <p>The retail chain wanted to move away from their previous vendor to a new Loyalty Programme having Payment Terminals and Pin Pads that would
      make the Sales experience smoother. The retail chain had Point-Of-Sale (POS) Terminals running DOS that provided an RS232 Interface for the billing data.
      The job was to capture the data over RS232, write to the Mifare cards, provide the POS terminal data from the Mifare card and to have an option to migrate
      the data from the old system to the new system by using free area on the Mifare cards.
      </p>
      <p><b><u>The Solution:</u></b></p>
      <p>Living and Developing the solution in Bahrain was an unforgettable experience. After engaging with the client and getting a detailed description of the requirements,
        understanding the pain points and their reasons for wanting the new solution, I began the coding binges in the hotel. The payment terminal API was well documented with 
        coding done in C. A GCC 3.4 Cross compiler provided by the payment terminal vendor and the code signing utilities provided as seamless development experience.
        The solution was developed in a mere 3 weeks and deployed just before Ramadan, just in time.
      </p>

      <p><b><u>The Requirement:</u></b></p>
      <p>The company I was working for needed a new server software to manage the calls for their VoIP phone terminals. The VoIP phone terminals running Arch Linux were
        managing the calls with the help of a Proprietary Server. Moving to FreeSwitch, a new management software had to be develeoped.
      </p>
      <p><b><u>The Solution:</u></b></p>
      <p>Using the Twisted Python Library, I worked on controlling FreeSwitch via the event system interface and managing the calls, initiating them, terminating them and provided
        an output interface to view the status of the calls

      <h4>Linux Kernel Code In the NASA Ingenuity Helicopter</h4>
      <p><i>My contribution the Linux Kernel earned me the Mars 2020 Contributor badge on GitHub</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p><b><u>The Requirement:</u></b></p>
      <p>Being a huge Music fan, I was into external DACs (Digital To Analog Converters or External Sound Cards)  in the mid-late 2000s. 
        I bought the Creative USB X-FI USB S51 and realzied that the Volume Knob on the device and the LED had no support under Linux. 
        Thus began the journey of learning how to write Linux Kernel Modules and patching the Linux Kernel.</p>
        <p>This contribution to the Linux Kernel earned me the <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/mndar?achievement=mars-2020-contributor&tab=achievements">Mars 2020 Contributor Badge</a> on GitHub</p>
      <p><b><u>The Solution:</u></b></p>
      <p>I used SniffUSB under WindowsXP to capture the USB Traffic as I used the Volume Knob and kept a watch on the LED on the Creative USB X-Fi S51. 
      After a few hours of capturing data and sifting through it, I traced down the Control Transfers in the URBs (USB Request Blocks) that had the repeating
      pattern with the Volume Knob being turned clockwise, anticlockwise and pressed (The volume knob also served as a button to mute audio). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Going through the Linux Kernel source code, I found the struct that held values for similar devices. Filling the values I had captured and many compiles and restarts a 
        few times got me a functional usbaudio kernel module that supported the volume knob and passed on the events to LIRC (Linux Infrared Remote Control). I made the patch and 
        sent the <a target="blank" href="https://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2010-October/033100.html">Patch on the Alsa-Devel mailing list</a> where it was reviewd and accepted into kernel 2.6.37.

      <h4>Surveillance - The Next Step In Video Monitoring</h4>
      <p><i>Emnbedded Linux Systems used as Surveillance Devices</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p><b><u>The Requirement:</u></b></p>
      <p>With increasing focus on our security, we need surveillance solutions to get better, faster. Solutions need to get smarter to reduce the human workload in monitoring systems. The project I developed is one such solution. It's called Surveillance. It’s not just an application which allows capture and storage of video stream 24x7. 
        It’s an extendable framework that allows you to do custom processing on video streams using simple shared libraries/ GStreamer plugins and report results in plain text, allowing you to easily parse it and take decisions. This system comprises of Cameras/Camera Sensors, Processing Hardware (camera endpoints) and a central server. Processing happens on the camera endpoints and is collected by the central server.</p>
      <p><b><u>The Solution:</u></b></p>
      <p>A custom GstMeta library provides an API for GStBaseTransform plugins to add custom metadata related to a video stream. The GstMeta is retreived and posted on the Gstreamer Bus which is retrieved by the monitoring application.
        I developed this as a framework. The monitoring application allows custom video analytics plugins to simply dropped in to a directory and configured for use with the monitoing application.
        I presented a talk at the <a target="blank" href="https://gstconf.ubicast.tv/permalink/v125619e7ab055tsn48u/iframe/">GStreamer Conference 2016 in Berlin</a> titled <b>Intelligent Surveillance</b> describing the project.

      <h4>Edge Analytics architecture on the NVidia Jetson Platform</h4>
      <p><i>An Extensible architecture using Nvidia Deepstream and GStreamer</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p><b><u>The Requirement:</u></b></p>
      <p>A Computer Vision company was running their algorithms as independent applicaitons. 
        The job was to develop an architecture using the Nvidia Deepstream framework that will allow plugging in of any algorithm for any appplication into the architecture.</p>
      <p><b><u>The Solution:</u></b></p>
      <p>Living in Chennai was a memorable experience. GStreamer expertise combined with the functionality provided by NVidia Deepstream provided the right tools for 
        developing an extensible architecture for the Edge Analytics platform. 
      </p><p>After integrating the <a target="blank" href="https://www.stereolabs.com/en-in/products/zed-2">Zed 2 from Stereolabs</a> with the <a target="blank" href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/"/>Nvidia Jetson platform</a>, I designed a architecture capable 
        of supporting growing number of applications using the <a target="blank" href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk">NVida Deepstream framework</a> for the company. Dynamically Loadable libraries were used to provide a "drop new functioanlity into directory" feature. The end result was a 
        happy client with architecture locked under NDA. That's why you don't see many details here. Sorry!

      <p><i>Finding duplicate addresses in a very large database</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p><b><u>The Requirement:</u></b></p>
      <p>Government Subsidized gas connections were being missued by fraudsters by manipulating addresses to receive a double subsidy. The job was to design
        and implement an algorithm to find such duplicate addresses, frequently manipulated tactfully to avoid theft detection.
      </p>
      <p><b><u>The Solution:</u></b></p>
      <p>Again not many details during the NDA but here's a broad view of what I did. Regex was used extensively to find known manipulated words. Using a geographical database,
        processing size was considerable reduced by running computationally heavy processing only on addresses grouped by approximate location. The result was a stunning expose on how
        miscreants were manipulating names and addresses to benefit from Government subsidies illegally.

      <hr>
      <p><b><u>The Requirement:</u></b></p>
      <p>CentOS ARMv7 was being built and a toolkit to generate rootfs images for various vendor boards was needed. Every vendor could release their their custom kernel and a mechanism was needed 
        where CentOS could be run there boards with custom kernels and packages.
      </p>
      <p><b><u>The Solution:</u></b></p>
      <p>After discussions with my mentor, I designed a Python based solution where a XML generated using a NCurses GUI (PyDialog) would be used to generated a custom RootFS for the board.

      <h4>OpenVPN for Voice Trading @ A Stock Trading Company</h4>
      <p><i>Embedded Linux Voip Phones networked over a Virtual Private Network (VPN)</i></p>
      <hr>
      <p><b><u>The Requirement:</u></b></p>
      <p>At the peak of COVID as the city went into lockdown, a stock trader was left with traders unable to trade efficiently as their voice trading terminals, voip phones running embeeded linux 
        couldn't be used from the trader's homes. I was hired to design a Virutal Private Network (VPN) solution to have them on the company network.
      </p>
      <p><b><u>The Solution:</u></b></p>
      <p>I designed the VPN solution to have a OpenVPN Server on the client's network exposed via their public IP. The Embeedded Linux terminals running Ubuntu were configured
       to have a OpenVPN client start at boot and login to the company network making them local rather than remote as far as the voip phone application running on them was concered. </p>

       <p>The VoIP application was designed to have the VoIP phones on a single network. After discussing with the architecture with the client, I desinged and implemented a OpenVPN server and 
        confiured OpenVPN clients on the the VoIP phones to 'hide' the fact that the terminals were actually remote.</p>
       </p>
      The result was a stock trader having full trading fucntionality during a Corona virus lockdown</p>
